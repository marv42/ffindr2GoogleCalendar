ffindr2GoogleCalendar reads ffindr RSS feeds and creates and updates Google
calendars with the events from the feeds.

ffindr is one of the biggest frisbee tournament portals on the web:
www.ffindr.com.



How it works:

updateAllGoogleCalendars.py reads the configuration file
google-calendar.json and calls the other scripts.

See 'updateAllGoogleCalendars.py -h' for usage descriptions.

The scripts use the Google Data Protocol (GData -
https://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client) for manipulating the Google
calendars.
